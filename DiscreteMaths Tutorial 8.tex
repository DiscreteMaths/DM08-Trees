Subtrees of a binary tree (8:3:1)


Example 8.2 Deleting a vertex from a graph

8.1.2 The number of edges in a tree.
Theorem 8.3 Let T be a tree with n vertices. Then T has n-1 edges.

A balanced binary tree has $2^i$ nodes on all levels i apart from the highest level.

A tree in which one vertex has been singled out in this way

Let x and y be vertices of T. If the unique path from the root r
to x in T passes through y, then y is called an ancestor of x and x is a 
descendant of y.

If the vertices y and x are adjacent on the path from r to x, then
y is called the parent of x and x is called the child of y.

%8.2.1 Binary Trees
\subsection{Binary Trees}
A binary child is a rooted tree in which each internal node has exactly
two children, the left child and right child respectively.
