Spanning trees
We say that a graph H is a subgraph of a graph G if its vertices are a subset of the
vertex set of G, its edges are a subset of the edge set of G, and each edge of H has
the same end-vertices in G and H.
De?nition 3.3 If H is a subgraph of G such that V (H) = V (G), then H is called a
spanning subgraph of G. If H is a spanning subgraph which is also a tree, then H is
said to be a spanning tree of G.
